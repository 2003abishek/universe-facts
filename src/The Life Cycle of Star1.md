## The Life Cycle of Stars

Stars undergo a life cycle that includes birth, maturity, and death. They begin as protostars in nebulae, then spend most of their lives fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. Depending on their mass, stars may end their lives as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes.
