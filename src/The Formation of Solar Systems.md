## The Formation of Solar Systems

Solar systems form from giant clouds of gas and dust called nebulae. Gravity causes these clouds to collapse and form a rotating disk of material, with a young star developing at the center. Over time, particles in the disk collide and stick together, forming planets, moons, and other celestial bodies.
