## The Cosmic Microwave Background

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the afterglow of the Big Bang, a faint radiation that fills the universe. Studying the CMB helps astronomers understand the universe's origin, structure, and evolution. It provides a snapshot of the universe when it was just 380,000 years old.
