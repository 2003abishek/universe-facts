## The Life Cycle of Stars

Stars are born in nebulae, massive clouds of gas and dust. Over time, gravity causes these clouds to collapse and form protostars. Depending on their mass, stars will spend millions to billions of years fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. When they run out of fuel, they may become red giants or supernovae, and eventually turn into white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes.
