# Gravitational Waves

Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects, such as colliding black holes or neutron stars. Predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity, gravitational waves were first detected in 2015 by the LIGO observatory, opening a new window into the universe.
