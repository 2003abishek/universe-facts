# The Oort Cloud

The Oort Cloud is a hypothetical vast, spherical shell of icy objects surrounding the solar system. It is believed to be the source of long-period comets, which take hundreds of thousands of years to orbit the sun. Understanding the Oort Cloud helps us learn about the origins of comets and the solar system's boundaries.
